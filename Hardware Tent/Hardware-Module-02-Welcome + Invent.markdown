# Hardware Tent Week 2: Hardware for Accessibility 
- moving spoon

The "Future of Accessible Cities" is a window display at Adaptive Design Association store front window located in New York City 313 W. 36th Street. People passing by can interact with a "flying" wheelchair via SMS. The future city is made of cardboard, littlebits, arduino and a motor. We want to encourage creative thinking about the future of accessibility in cities and society.

### Hack Your House: Make it Accessible

After playing with our littlebits cloud module for a “littleBit”, it became clear that our favorite thing to do with it was to activate it with an SMS (via IFTTT) and then have the cloud module turn on the DC motor module. We thought it would be fun to use this setup in the store front window of our workshop and have passersby use their phones to activate a motor in a window display. 

Our original littleBits set up was: power module -> cloud module -> DC motor module 

Our IFTTT recipe was: if SMS -> then cloud module
