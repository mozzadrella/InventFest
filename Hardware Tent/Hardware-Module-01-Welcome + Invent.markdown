# Hardware Module 1: Welcome to the BitLab:

littleBits has one mission: to put the power of electronics in the hands of everyone. And now the bitLabâ„¢ is putting the power of making electronics in the hands of everyone. We believe the next billion dollar idea isn't going to come from the big companies, it's going to come from you.

Have an idea? Submit a module. See a module you like? Vote for it. Developers get credit, fame and cash. Supporters get first dibs, offer feedback and most importantly, influence the development of the next great module. We will manufacture the most popular ones and sell them worldwide.

The largest hardware platform just became infinite.
