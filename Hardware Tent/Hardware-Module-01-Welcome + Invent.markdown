# Hardware Module 1: Welcome to the BitLab:

littleBits has one mission: to put the power of electronics in the hands of everyone. And now the bitLab™ is putting the power of making electronics in the hands of everyone. We believe the next billion dollar idea isn't going to come from the big companies, it's going to come from you.

Have an idea? Submit a module. See a module you like? Vote for it. Developers get credit, fame and cash. Supporters get first dibs, offer feedback and most importantly, influence the development of the next great module. We will manufacture the most popular ones and sell them worldwide.

The largest hardware platform just became infinite.

In order to submit a module for vote all you need to do is create a working prototype and document it.  As long as you can show it works, it doesn’t matter if it’s a PCB, a solderless breadboard, or anything in between.  
 
This week's challenge will help you get familiar with the BitLab [Hardware Development Kit.](http://littlebits.cc/kits/hdk) and to prototype your first Bit. We invite you to join the BitLab community in this first project.
