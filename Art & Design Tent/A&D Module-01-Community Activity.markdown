## Community Activity: "Make an Exhibit"
1. At your event, have everyone design and construct a building a remix of their favorite work of art (have them use the weekly project prompt).
2. After everyone is finished, install the various pieces around your space. Discuss with the group how the art should be organized. How will putting pieces next to each other change their meaning? What story is your space telling?
3. Take pictures of your installation and upload them to [MakerHub](http://littlebits.cc/projects)!
