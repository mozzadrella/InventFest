# Art and Design Module 2: Wear Your Art

>“I communicate, therefore I am” is the defining affirmation of contemporary existence, and objects and systems that were once charged only with formal elegance and functional soundness are now also expected to have personalities. Contemporary designers do not just provide function, form, and meaning, but also must draft the scripts that allow people and things to develop and improvise a dialogue.

We live in a time where we talk to our art--we touch it, talk to it, walk in step with it. The "Internet of Things," the ability to fuse objects and human behavior together, has opened opened up a wealth of creative opportunities. In this project, you'll create a piece of art that folks can carry with them.

# Design Constraints
1. Imagine going about your day in the year 3000. How are humans dressed? How do their clothes, glasses, pockets, shoes, communicate with the world around them? Do their sneakers take pictures and upload them to the cloud for GoogleMaps?
2. Sketch out a piece of clothing from the future.  
3. Your piece must literally engage the viewer--use the touch sensor, the cloudBit, temperature sensor or sound to interact with a human.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss the weekly resource for Module 2 for Art and Design
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Community Activity for Module 2 for Art and Design
