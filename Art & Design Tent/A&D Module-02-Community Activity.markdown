## Community Activity: The Smart Fashion Show
1. In teams of 2-4, have small groups work on their own wearable technology piece from the prompt. 
2. At the end of their design process, ask someone from the group to wear the design "down a runway" that you have set up in your space. 
3. Take pictures of the various "looks" your group has put together, and upload them to [MakerHub](http://littlebits.cc/makers).
