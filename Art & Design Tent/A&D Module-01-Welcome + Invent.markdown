# Art and Design Module 1: Interactive Sculpture / Installation 

Welcome to the art + design tent for InventFest. If you are here, you probably want to learn how to connect 3-D printing and littleBits, design funky products that whirrr-and-buzzz and fashion installations that make people go "wow."

1. [Drawing Bots, Generative Art Machines](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/drawing-bots-generative-art-machines)
Purpose: This workshop asks participants to use littleBits to 
create machines that can create drawings and paintings independently. 
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the 
use of an autonomous system. In discussing generative art and its principles, 
participants are challenged to invent their own drawing bots.

# Your Fellow BitStars
### Milind Sonavane & Sopan Sharma

>Milind & Sopan are the founders of @MakersparkIndia in Pune, India. They are the makers of the gorgeous Gramopaint, an arc art generator powered by littleBits and 3d printed components. We are big fans of this  duo here at littleBits and were excited to get to ask them some questions about their maker superpowers.

>**Whatâ€™s your maker superpower?**

>Inventing joyful devices that let people do more, think more, feel more. We are inspired by art, music, creativity and children at play they believe that keeping other makers in mind while making your own project is the key to inspiring action, and making the party bigger.
