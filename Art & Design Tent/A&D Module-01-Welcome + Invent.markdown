# Art and Design Module 1: Interactive Sculpture / Installation 

>“I communicate, therefore I am” is the defining affirmation of contemporary existence, and objects and systems that were once charged only with formal elegance and functional soundness are now also expected to have personalities. Contemporary designers do not just provide function, form, and meaning, but also must draft the scripts that allow people and things to develop and improvise a dialogue.

Welcome to the art + design tent for InventFest. If you are here, you probably want to learn how to connect 3-D printing and littleBits, design funky products that whirrr-and-buzzz and fashion installations that make people go "wow." 

We live in a time where we talk to our art--we touch it, talk to it, walk in step with it. The "Internet of Things," the ability to fuse objects and human behavior together, has opened opened up a wealth of creative opportunities.

In this project, you'll create a piece of art that interacts with the viewer in some way. 

# Design Constraints
1. Think about how you envision life in the year 3000. What about our interaction with technology makes you uncomfortable?
2. Create a design or installation that comments upon life in the future, as you envision it. 
3. Your piece must literally engage the viewer--use the touch sensor, the cloudBit, temperature sensor or sound to interact with a human. 

# Inspiration, Examples and Support

1. [Drawing Bots, Generative Art Machines](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/drawing-bots-generative-art-machines)
Purpose: This workshop asks participants to use littleBits to 
create machines that can create drawings and paintings independently. 
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the 
use of an autonomous system. In discussing generative art and its principles, 
participants are challenged to invent their own drawing bots.

# Your Fellow BitStars
### Milind Sonavane & Sopan Sharma

>Milind & Sopan are the founders of @MakersparkIndia in Pune, India. They are the makers of the gorgeous Gramopaint, an arc art generator powered by littleBits and 3d printed components. We are big fans of this  duo here at littleBits and were excited to get to ask them some questions about their maker superpowers.

>**What’s your maker superpower?**

>Inventing joyful devices that let people do more, think more, feel more. We are inspired by art, music, creativity and children at play they believe that keeping other makers in mind while making your own project is the key to inspiring action, and making the party bigger.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss Module 1 for Art and Design
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Community Activity for Module 1 of Art and Design
