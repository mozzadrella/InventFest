# Art and Design Module 1: Interactive Sculpture / Installation 

Welcome to the art + design tent for InventFest. If you are here, you probably want to learn how to connect 3-D printing and littleBits, design funky products that whirrr-and-buzzz and fashion installations that make people go "wow." 

We live in a time where we talk to our art--we touch it, talk to it, walk in step with it. The "Internet of Things," the ability to fuse objects and human behavior together, has opened opened up a wealth of creative opportunities.

In this project, you'll create a piece of art that interacts with the viewer in some way. 

# Design Constraints
1. Your sign should have at least one LED/lighted part and one moving part. 
2. The sign should tell the story of your town in your own way.
3. Make a short video of your sign in both "on" and "off" mode and say a little bit about how it describes you.

GOOOAAAAAL!!! This World Cup themed sign triggers wirelessly when you hit a button on your table. This project is made up of two circuits - one for the button and the other for the sign.

# Your Fellow BitStars
### Milind Sonavane & Sopan Sharma

>Milind & Sopan are the founders of @MakersparkIndia in Pune, India. They are the makers of the gorgeous Gramopaint, an arc art generator powered by littleBits and 3d printed components. We are big fans of this  duo here at littleBits and were excited to get to ask them some questions about their maker superpowers.

>**Whatâ€™s your maker superpower?**

>Inventing joyful devices that let people do more, think more, feel more. We are inspired by art, music, creativity and children at play they believe that keeping other makers in mind while making your own project is the key to inspiring action, and making the party bigger.
