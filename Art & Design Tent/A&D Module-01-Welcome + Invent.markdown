# Art and Design Module 1: Remix Your Art

Welcome to the art + design tent for InventFest. If you are here, you probably want to learn how to connect 3-D printing and littleBits, design funky products that whirrr-and-buzzz and fashion installations that make people go "wow." 

This week we'll be using littleBits to remix a piece by your favorite artist. Whose work do you really admire? How could you bring it to life using littleBits?

# Design Constraints
1. Find a picture of your favorite piece of art. 
2. Reimagine your favorite piece using littleBits. You can exaggerate the aspects you really like about the work, and to put your personal stamp on it. 
3. Your piece should include either sound bits (Mp3, synth bits, speaker) or light bits (long led, bar graph, numbers).

# Inspiration, Examples and Support

### MakerHub Favorites:

1. [Drawing Bots, Generative Art Machines](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/drawing-bots-generative-art-machines)
Purpose: This workshop asks participants to use littleBits to 
create machines that can create drawings and paintings independently. 
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the 
use of an autonomous system. In discussing generative art and its principles, 
participants are challenged to invent their own drawing bots.

2. [Laser Listening Bunny Sculpture](http://littlebits.cc/projects/laser-listening-bunny-sculpture)

>Make a sculpture any way you want! I never made a found objects sculpture before, so I made it up as I went along. First I collected shells and glass and things at the beach in the colors of my bunny. Then I drew the bunny on my fruit crate board. Next I hot glued the items according to color and shape and pushed grout in between all the stuff. I scrubbed the glass and shells clean before the grout hardened!  After that dried overnight I used "masking fluid" to protect the shells and glass and then painted the picture with acrylic paint. Finally I removed the rubbery masking fluid.

# Your Fellow BitStars
### Milind Sonavane & Sopan Sharma

>Milind & Sopan are the founders of @MakersparkIndia in Pune, India. They are the makers of the gorgeous Gramopaint, an arc art generator powered by littleBits and 3d printed components. We are big fans of this  duo here at littleBits and were excited to get to ask them some questions about their maker superpowers.

>**Whatâ€™s your maker superpower?**

>Inventing joyful devices that let people do more, think more, feel more. We are inspired by art, music, creativity and children at play they believe that keeping other makers in mind while making your own project is the key to inspiring action, and making the party bigger.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss Module 1 for Art and Design
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Community Activity for Module 1 of Art and Design
