# Art & Design Module 2: 

We're big fans of IDEO, and love their "[Method Cards](http://www.ideo.com/work/method-cards/)." Which tools do you use for design inspiration? What do they help you accomplish?

IDEO Method Cards is a collection of 51 cards representing diverse ways that design teams can understand the people they are designing for. They are used to make a number of different methods accessible to all members of a design team, to explain how and when the methods are best used, and to demonstrate how they have been applied to real design projects.
