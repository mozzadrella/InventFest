# Art and Design Module 3: That Sculpture is Alive!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RshSaF_juGs

This design prompt will ask you to use a 3D printer to create a sculpture that really moves people (teehee!). We're going to get a little bit heady here: we're asking you to use littleBits + a 3D printer to think about *time.*

Your project might tackle:
- Accumulating time: an inch of height, the minute hand on a clock.
- Frozen time: a fountain of youth, a black hole.
- Erosion + time: rust, patina, evolution. 

(Adapted from [Virginia Griswold's time-based sculpture assignment](http://sculpture.artapsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vgriswold_syllabus_sculpt1_updated2014.pdf)).

# Design Constraints
1. Your project must either use a 3D printer or a lasercutter (post the STL files with the projct).
2. Your project must physically move: think about using your motors as an output. 
3. The project must be posted in a way that others may easily replicate it.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future
