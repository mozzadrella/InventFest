# Art & Design Module 1: Remixing and Empathy

Attribution + remixing is a thorny issue, for certain. For kids, automatically giving the original artist attribution isn't enough--recognition must happen human-to-human.

In your piece, how would you choose to attribute or pay homage to the original artist?

>...for users of Scratch, automatic
attribution was generally seen as insincere and insuf-
ficient. Throughout the interviews, we found that for most
of the kids, getting explicit credit from another person was
preferred over attribution given automatically by the system.
When asked why, kids often responded that knowing that
another person had cared enough to give credit was valued
more than what the computer system would do on its own.
The fact that it takes some work, albeit minimal, to write
an acknowledgment statement, sends a signal of empathy,
authenticity and good intentions [6]. Amy articulated thiswhen explaining why she preferred getting credit from another
person:

>I would like it even more if the person did it [gave
credit] on their own accord, because it would mean that
[...] they weren’t trying to copy it, pirate it.
Similarly, Jon explained, “No [the “Based on” is not
enough], because he [the remixer] didn’t put that, it always
says that.” 

>For Jon, automatic attribution is not authentic because
it is always there and, as a result, it is clear that is not
coming from the person doing the remix.
