We've asked you to think about a casual meetup around food. You may be wondering "Why do @chloeatplay + Vanessa suggest we make food together?" Because folks who eat together, make together. Check out the various ways people around the internet are coming together around food.

# Core Questions
1. When is the last time you "meet" someone because of food (at a meetup, or on Instagram or Pinterest)?
2. How does food inspire us to share and learn each other's backgrounds?
3. What littleBits projects can you make that are food-themed? We can't wait to see!

# Why Food Binds Us to Each Other

>“Your first relationship as a human being is about food,” says Richard Wilk, anthropology professor at the University of Indiana and head of its food studies program. “The first social experience we have is being put to the breast or bottle. The social act of eating, is part of how we become human, as much as speaking and taking care of ourselves. Learning to eat is learning to become human.”

# Meals Together Form Deeper Bonds

>In many countries, mealtime is treated as sacred. In France, for instance, while it is acceptable to eat by oneself, one should never rush a meal. A frenzied salad muncher on the métro invites dirty glares, and employees are given at least an hour for lunch. In many Mexican cities, townspeople will eat together with friends and family in central areas like parks or town squares. In Cambodia, villagers spread out colorful mats and bring food to share with loved ones like a potluck.

>In her book Eating Together, Alice Julier argues that dining together can radically shift people’s perspectives: It reduces people’s perceptions of inequality, and diners tend to view those of different races, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds as more equal than they would in other social scenarios.
