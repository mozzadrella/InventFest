 - **Basics**: Make your kitchen glow. Decorate your tablescape using littleBits + playdoh. 
 - **Internet of Things**: How will we eat in the future? Use littleBits to build a new appliance, or make our lunch process “smarter.”
 - **Music**: Create an instrument that changes “moods” based on different foods (or courses!)
 - **Art + Design**: Conservation is cool. Make a kitchen appliance that either conserves energy or shows how much energy is being used in a creative way.
 - **Science:** Kitchen safety is key! Prototype a device that will tell you when your food is “done” (and not over-done!)
 - **Hardware**: Making food is difficult--you have to ensure you have the right ingredients, stand at the stove, make sure things don’t burn. Design a bit that would make it easier to cook remotely or with others.
