# IoT Module Week 1: If these Walls Could Talk!
Welcome to the Internet of Things tent for InventFest! If you are here, you probably have poked around with the [Smart Home Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/smart-home-kit), or at least have a [Cloudbit](http://littlebits.cc/bits/cloudbit) that will allow you to "snap the internet to anything." 

This first, your design challenge will be to use the kit to hack your house. We'll provide some design constraints, a few example projects to get you started, and then you'll be on your way. 

# Design Constraints
1. Consider your house from the point-of-view of your pet or an inanimate object. Is your cat bored? Is your Roomba sad? 
2. Create a project that improves the livelihood of that pet/thing **and** upcycles something in your house. (Think old wallets, floppy disks, plastic bottles, [a plastic bottle](http://littlebits.cc/projects/littlepiggy-bank--3)--have at it!)

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

Check out all the stellar projects that use the [Smart Home Kit on MakerHub](http://littlebits.cc/projects/smart_home_kit/featured?order_by=published_at#browse).

3 of our favorites are:

1. Feed your pet, don't let them get hungry! Check out the remote pet feeder:

### Make Your Bits Talk to Other Things
IFFT (a service that stands for "if this, then that") offers recipes that combine your Cloudbit, an object and you.

### Future of Accessible Cities Window Display

After playing with our littlebits cloud module for a “littleBit”, it became clear that our favorite thing to do with it was to activate it with an SMS (via IFTTT) and then have the cloud module turn on the DC motor module. We thought it would be fun to use this setup in the store front window of our workshop and have passersby use their phones to activate a motor in a window display. 

Our original littleBits set up was: power module -> cloud module -> DC motor module 

Our IFTTT recipe was: if SMS -> then cloud module

### Friday’s Tips and Tricks: What household item enhances any lighting project?

German playwright Bertolt Brecht said that the essence of art is to see things differently, even in your daily life. Through the eye of an artist, any common item in your house can be a source of inspiration for your project. Let’s find out which household items can help you enhance your light based projects.

### Bristle Bot

In this littleBits project you attach a vibration motor to the head of a tooth brush to create your own robot! By adjusting the dimmer, you can control the movement of the little bot making him travel slowly and smoothly or quickly and in every direction!

### Andy Reed, MakerDad

Andy has been an inspiration for our community with his truly unique story. After a career in finance and high tech, Andy Reed decided to move back to Sonoma, California, with his family and purchase a six-acre farm.  A true problem solver and maker at heart, Andy used littleBits to deal with a unique situation: he has a farm full of chickens, but he never knew whether they have the right amount of food. To find out, he or his daughters would have to walk all the way to the coop and inspect the feed. Watch the video above to see how Andy and his family rigged up a clever enclosure using the cloudBit to monitor his chicken feed from across the yard or from across the world!

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Weekly Resource
2. Community Activity
3. Meetup
