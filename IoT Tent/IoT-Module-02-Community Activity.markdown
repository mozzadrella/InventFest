## Core Questions

- If you could revise this activity for a group, what would that look like?
- Post your activity in Discourse below. 
- We've included a community activity you can pick up and use for your chapter or local group. 

# Community Activity: Safety Hackathon
1. In your community, reach out to a local law enforcement officer. Who is the public-facing official? Invite them to come give a short presentation on local crime matters in your community, and potential solutions your crew could develop. You may also want to reach out to your local ACLU, Open Data Organization, or local non-profits for more ideas.
2. In pairs, develop a product using littleBits that could potentially solve your community's safety issue. 
3. After 2-3 hours of prototyping, share out to the group and post to the littleBits project page.
