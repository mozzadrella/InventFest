## Community Activity: The Quantified Cafe.
Sensors allow us to track temperatures, increases in pressure, changes in sound. Imagine how our human-to-human interactions *with strangers* will change in the era of the Internet of Things. 

This design prompt will ask you to design the a Quantified Bar or Cafe. 

1. In groups of 3-4, decide which aspects of human behavior you'd like to measure. What kinds of interactions do you want to nuture + provoke? Avoid?
2. Collaboratively, draft a floorplan of your dream cafe with your ideas for sensors and circuits described. 
3. In 60 minutes, do your best to build those circuits.
4. Present to the rest of the team in a mock skit showing how your design affects or measures human behavior.
5. Publish your floorplan, circuits and skit to MakerHub.
