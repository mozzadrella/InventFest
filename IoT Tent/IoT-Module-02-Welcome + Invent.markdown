# Iot Module Week 2: Safety First! Hack

littleBits are more than just toys; they are powerful prototyping tools that we can use to solve bigger problems: inequity, neighborhood safety, tools that prevent accidents and the like. 

This week's hack will ask you to use your "extra-sensory perception" (:p) to make something in your life safer.  

### Design Constraints
1. Your product should use a sensory input, your cloudBit and an IFFT recipe.
2. Describe the inspiration for the project and the problem you are trying to solve.
3. In your video, demo your project in action. 

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

### The Mind-Reader Helmet

>MindRider, the brain-reading bike helmet system, generates new kinds of health data and health sense-making at the individual and regional scale. Every MindRider helmet employs a distinctive combination of two head-based wearable technologies, the bike helmet and the EEG (electroencephalography) sensor, giving users new insight into their mental experiences as they ride.

### The Candle Killer

### Perfect Safe

Do you dream about safe which holds securely all your gems? Just imagine it — strong case, big numbered wheel on door and secret passcode that nobody knows (except you naturally). You don't need travel to New York and register at JP Morgan's Vault on Manhattan. Just sit in you room and make you own safe! 

Perfect safe is built from Arduino module which take care about passcode set through dimmer module, servo which control lock mechanism and few other parts (buzzer, LED, switch).

### ROAR: Wearable Technology for Women's Safety

Roar will attempt to do that with wearable technology no bigger than a watch face. When activated, it will emit a loud alarm and flashing lights. Interacting with the wearer's phone via a Bluetooth chip, it also will call 911 and send a text alert of the person's whereabouts to designated contacts.

The company also has developed a phone app that will notify users of crime patterns in their vicinity and allow them to input their own safety-related observations.

### Texting Increases Human Trafficking Victims’ Access to Help
“BeFree” text shortcode instantly connects victims to services from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center 

Washington, DC (March 28, 2013) – Human trafficking victims across the country can now send texts to get help and escape modern-day slavery, Polaris Project and Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children announced today. Victims and concerned citizens can now send text messages to “BeFree” (233733) and instantly connect with the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) hotline (1-888-3737-888), operated by Polaris Project.
