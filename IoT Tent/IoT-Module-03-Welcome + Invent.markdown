# IoT Week 3: Rethinking the Dinner Party

Now that we can express ourselves in measured text messages, Tweets, emoji and Instagram photos, how do we define "conversation"? What do we value about dialogue? When you've had fruitful human-human interactions in the internet, what elements did those conversations have?

This weekly invent will ask you to brainstorm what you value about conversation, and use the cloudBit to design how you think humans *should* interact over the Internet. 

## Design Constraints
1. Brainstorm what a dinner party on the internet might look like. How would you like your guests to interact?
2. Use the cloudBit to send text messages, images or sounds between those humans.
3. When you upload your project, post your version of a "seating chart" whatever that shakes out to be in your project.

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

### Turkey Table Timer

It’s dinnertime and you are putting finishing touches on the meal! The Turkey Table Timer helps you make sure your guests sit down the minute the food is ready, rather than you having to round them up. Just set the timeout when you are almost done and the Turkey will beckon your guests to come enjoy the feast by shaking its servo tail, flashing an rgb LED and buzzing to a pulse.

### The Punisher

The Punisher is a device to encourage focus and concentration, with an incentive to keep your hands off your phone - when the device senses your phone has been removed from the platform, it sends a message to IFTTT to post an embarrassing status message on your Facebook account.

### 12 Hacks of Christmas – Day 7: Spread Christmas Cheer With littleBits, Laravel and Twilio
My mom’s favorite Christmas song is “I’ll be home for Christmas” which means I’m in major trouble since I won’t be making the trip to KC to visit her this year. I imagine many of you, like me, may not be able to spend the holidays with your families. I wanted to build a hack that helps people feel connected to the ones they love no matter how many miles separate them. My creation is a hardware device that will play a clip of a Christmas song whenever someone sends a text to a Twilio number. I can share this number with my family, they can text whenever they want and I’ll have a festive way of knowing they’re thinking of me. Check out this video to see it in action:

This awesome Gumball Machine is dedicated to Geof Lipman, Engineering Team Lead of littleBits. You are awesome and I appreciate you for spending your time with us! Have you ever thought of having your own Gumball Machine? With this awesome flower pot, you could send a text message (#GeofGumball) from your phone to the Cloud Module and receive a gumball! Well, I would receive a gumball but I could definitely mail it to you if you'd like! Send #GeofGumball to (415)-799-4278 to let me know you're connected! ;) 
Be a Maker!
