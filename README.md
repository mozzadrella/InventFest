# About InventAnything

## "littleBits are so awesome, but we need help figuring out what to do with them."
Librarians, makerspace people and after-school mentors told us this time and again. So we at littleBits HQ teamed up with some of our core community members and the design team at Peer 2 Peer University to bring you InventAnything, 

InventAnything is a free, five week online course to level up your maker skills and meet new friends from around the world. We've activated our network of designers, musicians, engineers and educators to make a "littleBit" of magic together. 

You can expect a weekly design challenge on the Discourse forums, a face-to-face meetup each week to debug your project and meet a celebrity maker, and at the end of the program a 25% discount on littleBits.com. 

## How Do I Navigate InventAnything?
### Getting started:
Start at [InventAnything URL], jump into a track that appeals to you. 
Poke around our forums at (http://discuss.littlebits.cc/t/welcome-introduce-yourself/11279). Add a comment, check out the categories, complete your profile. Make a small change, but contribute.
Accept a design challenge, and get started making a project!

### Once a week, you can expect:
- Activity on discuss.littlebits.cc: prompt for a new project, ideas on a controversial debate, a group activity
- Face-to-face meetups at (https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/littlebits). 
- We'll host Q&A's with fancypants famous-makers, showcase our projects and host design critiques.
- Emails that summarize tasty community activity and catch you up on all the buzzzzz.

### We're building a global littleBits network:
At the end of the course, you'll have put together your own playful event using littleBits. We'll work with you on event design, supporting your activities, and growing your local network of bitSTARs. 

## Our Learning Philosophy
littleBits is a mission-driven organization: we're putting the power of electronics into the hands of the next generation of inventors. In addition to hands-on learning, here's what we believe:
- **Interest-driven.** You'll work on projects that are of your choosing, and dazzle or entrance you. No dry videos, no quizzes.
- **Open + participatory.** Anyone can join, anyone can contribute and we create a safe space so anyone can speak.
- **Community-powered.** We're making InventAnything together. We are always teaching and learning at the same time.
- **Playful.** You'll learn best when you are having fun. 
All of those values are backed into the tools we use and the tools we make. 

## The InventAnything Team: the Hostesses with the Mostest
InventAnything is the brainchild of Chloe Varelidi, Director of Global Community at littleBits and Vanessa Gennarelli, Learning Lead at Peer 2 Peer University. Chloe is a game designer, an a former assessment guru at Mozilla Foundation, and a Resident at Eyebeam In New York. Vanessa has designed learning communities with NYU, Wikimedia, Mozilla, and Creative Commons.
