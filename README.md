About InventAnything


At littleBits we believe in empowering more people around the world to be creators and not just consumers of technology. That is why we deeply care about supporting our community in their learning journey as makers. And starting today we are offering a free online course to help anyone around the world learn how to # InventAnything using littleBits. Together we can start an open hardware revolution!

The course is free, online, and open to anyone who wants to participate. It is peer-powered by P2PU, and you can follow the five week curriculum starting on February the 25th or go at your own pace.  
^i'm not sure what 'go at your own pace' means. people can join in late?

Our Learning Philosophy
Interest-driven. You'll work on projects that are of your choosing, and dazzle or entrance you. No dry videos, no quizzes.
Open + participatory. Anyone can join, anyone can contribute and we create a safe space so anyone can speak.
Community-powered. We're making InventAnything together. We are always teaching and learning at the same time.
Playful. You'll learn best when you are having fun. 

How Does It Work?

SIGN UP
Don't miss out on weekly assignments, buzzworthy community recaps and a very special x% discount upon graduation. We pinky swear you will love our emails. 

FIND YOUR CREW
Connect with other bitsters who share similar passions by choosing one or more tracks. You can think about them like departments in a school. 
^are you going to list the tracks here?

JOIN THE DISCUSSION
Much of the activity is designed to encourage peer to peer learning and takes place in our online discussion forum. 

LEARN NEW SKILLS
Take design challenges to hone on your maker chops and problem-solve with other bit'sters.

MEET IN REAL TIME 
Hangout with other bit'sters during our weekly community calls for real-time networking and support. 
Each week we will also have special guests joining us:

Eric Rosenbaum, co-creator of Makie-Makie , Dr. Alex Ruthmann Associate Professor of Music Technology and Music Education at NYU, Ariel Wieldman founder of SpaceHack.org and Mitchel Resnick, head of the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab.
^typo, should be MaKey MaKey

MENTOR OTHERS
Go beyond making and teach others in your local community how to #inventanything. By the end of the course, you'll have put  together your own playful event using littleBits. To celebrate we will host a global make-a-thon with everyone who took the course. 
^i feel like the make-a-thon is a pretty big deal and maybe should be brought out more as a feature?

LEVEL UP
Upon graduation you will be able to apply to unlock exclusive bitSTAR status which includes a fancy badge on your profile and 20% discount on your next purchase.
